# Container Examples Suite

This suite contains a collection of simple containers to use as examples for running containers in docker and kubernetes. 
Each container demonstrates a different concept or use case.

## Containers

The containers are based on the `alpine` image and are written in `bash`. The containers are designed to be simple but useful.
They are created for multiple architectures (linux/amd64 and linux/arm64/v8) and are available 
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/mhus).
